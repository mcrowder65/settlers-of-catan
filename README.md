This program is a software version of the popular board game known as Settlers of Catan.<br>

Over 400 man hours were put into this semester long project.<br>

The client and server are both written in Java.<br>

We used a sqlite database to save the states of the games.<br>

Up to 4 players can play together at one time.<br>
